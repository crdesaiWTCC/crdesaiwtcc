Chris Desai: crdesai@my.waketech.edu  
I am a college freshman with aspirations to code and make music-related things.  
This repository is for my profile.  
I sadly couldn't "clone" the repository to my Macbook like how people traditionally would, but I would just download it as a .zip file and decompress it.  

# About Me
## My Specialties
I am very invested in music technology. My passion for music sprouted when I was **just 13**! In learning about sound, neuroscience, and music theory in my teenage years, I gathered a lot of useful insight on life's mysteries. Using my creative imagination and technology, I pursue a calling from my Heavenly Father to make music!
I have made quite a few songs throughout this adolescence of struggle, but because of the fact that I don't want to dox myself, I will not post them in this repository.
## My Suggested Sites
* [Cymatics.fm](https://cymatics.fm/): Steven Cymatics made his own website that has a plethora of music sample packs that are usable across a multitude of music genres, audio plugins that can be used for spicing up music in many different ways, and hidden tips and tricks for making spotlight music! He has made history by collaborating with top artists to make royalty-free content for others to use to make professional quality music! Even after years, Cymatics pushes out new and unique content very frequently, and it never disappoints!

* [Reaper.fm](https://reaper.fm/): Though not the _most_ beginner-friendly, REAPER by Cockos is my favorite DAW (digital audio workstation) of all! It features endless customization with themes and settings, excellent resource efficiency, and its own dedicated API for coding music plugins! In spite of the learning curve with this program, I love to use this for music production, and even music videos with JSFX made by the community! This was worked on since August 23, 2006, and still is widely used among music producers today.
